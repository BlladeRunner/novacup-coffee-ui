Clean layouts, reusable components, and responsive design.

## 🚀 Overview

**NovaCup Coffee UI** is a frontend-focused web application that demonstrates how a modern coffee brand interface can be built with clarity, structure, and scalability in mind.

The project is intentionally UI-first, with an emphasis on:

* clean visual hierarchy
* reusable UI components
* responsive layouts
* readable and maintainable code
